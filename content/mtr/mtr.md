## Introduction

The following document acts as an extension to the existing official [Magic Tournament Rules](http://wpn.wizards.com/en/document/magic-gathering-tournament-rules) and the unofficial [TopDeck Competitive REL MTR/IPG Addendum for Commander Events](https://topdeck.gg/mtr-ipg-addendum).

This will address smaller local events through to larger events such as qualifiers & multi day events. By having this document, events throughout the country will be consistent and TOs (Tournament Organisers) will have a central reference point to aid event set-up.

Please note, the following rules may vary when the event being hosted is a qualifier. Events classified as a qualifier may need to follow an alternative ruleset which will be at the discretion of the organisation hosting the event being qualified for.

## Code of Conduct

In addition to rules defined in [MTR - 5.4 - Unsporting Conduct](https://blogs.magicjudges.org/rules/mtr5-4/), the following rules also apply:

- Players are expected to foster a welcoming and accepting community.  Discrimination based on disability, race, gender, sexual identity, religion, or any other physical, cultural, or social characteristic will not be tolerated.
- We expect all our competitors to behave with sportsmanship at all times. This includes, but is not limited to, graciousness in both winning and losing, respect for their opponents, and behaving in a fair, kind, and reasonable manner.
- “Spite plays”, “kingmaking”, and intentionally losing or "throwing" are examples of unsportsmanlike behaviour and may be subject to penalty or suspension. Check the section below for more details.
- Players are expected to have a general understanding of how to operate the system(s) that they are using to play in the tournament. This includes, but is not limited to: properly reporting match results, finding their game, or using tournament software. Failure to do so in a timely fashion will result in an infraction. Tournament officials may exercise their discretion in assisting players with solving their technical issues, but are in no way required to do so.

## Tournament Structure

### Swiss Rounds (subject to changes)

This will be subject to player attendance, but the Tournament Organiser reserves the right to adjust the following to meet venue/time constraints. Adjustments may not be available when hosting qualifiers that adopt rules from other TOs.

|Players|Minimum Number of Swiss Rounds|Playoff|
|-|-|-|
|1-4|None (run 1 single elimination round)|None|
|5-15|2|Top 4|
|16-24|3|Top 10|
|25-32|4|Top 10|
|33-64|5|Top 16|
|65-128|6|Top 16|
|129-256|7|Top 40|

### Top Cut - Playoffs

Players in top cut will play in seed order with the highest seed taking the first turn.

Pods for top 16 should be created as such, where the numbers are players with the given seed after the Swiss portion:

|Pod|First Player|Second Player|Third Player|Fourth Player|
|-|-|-|-|-|
|A|1|8|9|16|
|B|2|7|10|15|
|C|3|6|11|14|
|D|4|5|12|13|

Pods for top 10 should be created as such, where players in the first and second seeds are automatically advanced to the finals:

|Pod|First Player|Second Player|Third Player|Fourth Player|
|-|-|-|-|-|
|A|3|6|7|10|
|B|4|5|8|9|

### Top 4 - Finals

The Finals seating will be based on the standings the players got during the Swiss portion, with the highest ranked player going first. The Semi final matches don’t affect this.

If for logistical reasons, the single elimination portion must have a time limit, then by the time a match ends and no winner is found, the highest ranked player in the standings during the swiss rounds is considered the winner.

We will be using byes when the number of players is not divisible by 4. A player can only be awarded one bye during the tournament, and it will be awarded to the lowest ranking player in the standings.

- If the Tournament’s Swiss portion is only 3 rounds, then we will be running pods of 3 players instead of awarding byes.

## Event Software

cEDH UK recommends the use of the TopDeck software by TopDeck.

Please head to topdeck.gg and create your account, it takes 1 minute and is free for players. For tournament organisers there is a monthly fee but we have a cEDH UK account that organisers can use.

Each event page will allow you to submit your decklist and view pairings and standings. There is also a mobile app for players to access the same information.

## Tournament Rules

- We will use the point system defined in the Multiplayer Addendum:
  - A Win awards 5 points
  - A Draw awards 1 point (for all players except those choosing to individually concede or incurring harsh penalties - Game Loss, Match Loss, Disqualification)
  - A Loss awards 0 points
  - A Bye awards 5 points
  - Any player receiving a bye will have 3 opponents added to their opponent history with a .25 win rate percentage.

- Each swiss round lasts 90 minutes (active player finishes their turn) or 75 minutes (one extra turn per active player). This decision is down to the TO unless the event is a qualifier influenced by the hosts of the event being qualified for.
- Seating order will be set automatically, as well as the turn order using TopDeck.
- There is no time limit in the single elimination portion (except exceeding venue time limit). In the case where players decide to Intentionally Draw a game during the single elimination portion, a 120 minutes round time limit will be enforced.

  - This is done to place a limit on the number of Intentional Draws that can happen and potentially extend the single elimination portion indefinitely.
  - This means that players are free to Intentionally Draw a game, but by doing so, the next game(s) they play will have to take the clock into consideration.
  - This 120 minutes time limit includes the round time already spent.
  - If the time runs out without a winner in the single elimination portion, the highest ranked player in the swiss rounds is considered the winner.

- Apply the official Commander Banlist.
- Rules on Playtest cards are down to each individual TO or in the event of a qualifier, it will be down to the hosts of the event being qualified for. Check the section below for details.
- Penalties: Check the link on the Rules Enforcement Level.
- After each match, players will need to notify the TO of the result or fill in a match slip provided by the organisation.
- After the winner of the tournament is determined, the remaining standings are defined by the ranking achieved in the Swiss portion of the event.
- Non-deterministic loops are allowed, check the section below for more details. Judges discretion regarding if the loop is non deterministic based on hands and board states, Rhystic Stydies, resources etc

## Playtest Cards

There are three different terms to refer to Magic cards that aren’t actual Magic cards. Proxies, Playtest Cards, and Counterfeits.

From the WPN Terms and Conditions:

    (j) Proxy Cards. Retail Stores may only allow “proxy” cards in your Events as described in the current official Magic Tournament Rules. A proxy card is a card issued by a Judge at an Event to replace a card that has become damaged during the course of play in such Event and may only be used for the duration of that Event.
    (k) Counterfeit Cards. Counterfeit cards are unauthorized reproductions of authentic Wizards cards. Counterfeit cards are strictly prohibited by Wizards. WPN Members who knowingly manufacture, import, use or distribute counterfeit cards (or facilitate the same by a third party) will have their WPN Membership immediately terminated. Wizards reserves all rights in law and at equity to prosecute individuals engaged in the manufacture, importation or distribution of counterfeit cards.
    (l) Playtest Cards. A playtest card is most commonly a basic resource with the name of a different card written on it with a marker. Playtest cards are not reproductions of authentic Wizards products and are created by players for personal and non-commercial use to test deck concepts. The use of playtest cards is allowed within Retail Stores only for non-commercial use in unsanctioned events.

Counterfeit cards are not allowed, the inclusion of any such cards in your deck will result in immediate disqualification. We do not support the production of illegitimate cards.

We understand that most cEDH decks require a significant financial investment, often prohibitive for players. Some cards are so expensive that it makes many players uncomfortable to physically play with their authentic cards. When signing up for events please check each individual page for their playtest rules.

- Players are responsible for making sure their playtest cards are acceptable by the Judge Team, and are expected to check the validity with them.
- The Judge Team will evaluate the cards using the same principles defined in the MTR - 3.3 - Authorized Cards, with the exception of the following points:

- Authorized Game Cards must be regulation-sized ~~, genuine Magic cards publicly released by Wizards of the Coast~~.
  - Ignore the strikethrough text
- ~~Cards that, unaltered, feature gold borders on their front or back, and~~ cards from the “Heroes of the Realm”, Theros block “Challenge Deck” series, silver bordered cards and acorn symbolled cards are not Authorized Game Cards.
  - Ignore the strikethrough text

## Main Rules

### Rules Enforcement Levels

cEDH UK Events are played under Competitive Rules Enforcement Level. You are expected to know the rules when you sit down to play. Judges will be present to enforce rules and answer any questions.  The Judge Team will apply the [Magic Infraction Procedure Guide](http://wpn.wizards.com/en/document/magic-infraction-procedure-guide) with the addendum of the [TopDeck Competitive REL MTR/IPG Addendum for Commander Events](https://topdeck.gg/mtr-ipg-addendum).

In the event a judge does not wish to issue a turn skip or a match loss cEDH UK events will adopt the ‘Skip Priority’ penalty.

The Penalty consists in the player Passing Priority on every action until the end of their next turn.

- The player will still put triggered abilities on the stack, choose targets for them, and resolve them.
- The player will be able to pay costs (such as when resolving triggers from Remora, Pact of Negation, Mana Vault, Rhystic Study).
- The player will be allowed to declare blockers.
- The player will only be allowed to declare mandatory attackers (such as creatures that must attack).
- The player will not be allowed to play a land.
- The player will not be allowed to cast a spell by normal means (but they can if they are resolving a triggered ability, like Rebound or Suspend).
- The player will not be allowed to activate abilities (except mana abilities to pay for costs).

An important highlight is that a Game Loss or Match Loss penalty will always result in the offending player receiving 0 points for the match, ignoring a potential draw result.

Keep in mind that in accordance with the Multiplayer Addendum to the Infraction Procedure Guide, an accumulation of Warnings within the same infraction results in an upgrade to Game Loss.

### Judges

Our Judges are here to help you! If you notice anything that seems shady, odd, or out of place, please call a Judge. If you have any rules questions, please call a Judge. In addition to the directives defined in this document, the Judge team will follow the directives in the following documents, so it is in your interest to get familiar with them:

[Official MTR](https://blogs.magicjudges.org/rules/mtr/)

[Official IPG](https://blogs.magicjudges.org/rules/ipg/)

Throughout the event, Judges will perform deck checks. This process includes verifying that all cards in a player's deck match the registered decklist. Make sure the decklist you register is accurate.

Remember that no ruling aside from the Head Judge’s is considered final as soon as it is given. If for whatever reason you wish to get a second opinion, please tell the ruling Judge that you would like to appeal to the Head Judge.

### Non-Deterministic Loops

According to the [MTR - 4.4 Loops](https://blogs.magicjudges.org/rules/mtr4-4/):

```
“A loop is a form of tournament shortcut that involves detailing a sequence of actions to be repeated and then performing a number of iterations of that sequence. The loop actions must be identical in each iteration and cannot include conditional actions (‘If this, then that’.)”
```

In an effort to allow more strategies and diversity amongst decks, some non-deterministic loops, such as those associated with shuffling the deck or any other random element, are allowed. If a player is unsure of how their opponent's loop functions, or is unsure if an opponent can perform the loop, please immediately call a Judge.

If a player executing a loop is incapable of concisely communicating the loop to a Judge, they will not be allowed to perform the loop, as that results in Slow Play. The Head Judge is the final authority on what constitutes an allowed non-deterministic loop.

A player wanting to interrupt a non-deterministic loop will need to be able to do so in a non-deterministic way (when a certain condition is met). That will be allowed, and in case of any doubt, call a Judge.

### Collusion, Kingmaking, and Spite Plays

In game theory, a “king maker” is a player who lacks sufficient resources or position to win at a given game, but possesses enough remaining resources to decide which of the remaining viable players will eventually win.

One element of a multiplayer format is that players can take game actions that allow other players to win accidentally.

Judges will not regulate suboptimal gameplay.

If you believe a player is “king making”, colluding with another player, or performing a “Spite Play”, please call a Judge.

These constitute a violation of the code of conduct and will be treated as such. Collusion in particular is a very serious offense.

Players may not use this anti-kingmaking policy to abuse their opponent’s position as a shield to attempt to win, for example:

- Player A has a win attempt, player B has a win attempt that player A knows about and player C only has one answer to stop A or B but not Both. In this situation, player A cannot just try to win and use the argument that if player C uses their answer, it would be king making.

Keep in mind that sometimes a player might seem to be performing a “king making” or “spite play” decision, when in reality that line of play is the one that favours them most in the tournament progression, for example:

- During Swiss rounds, player A presents a win, player B has a Pact of Negation with no mana to pay for the trigger on their next upkeep. However player B believes that by stopping player A they might have a chance that the game ends in a draw therefore resulting in them gaining 1 point instead of 0.
- Player A presents a win, and they have Force of Will that player B saw in a previous turn via Gitaxian Probe, player B has a Pact of Negation, with no way to pay for the trigger in the next upkeep, but player B suspects that player C has interaction. Because player B is the first to respond, they must play the Pact of Negation so that player A uses their Force of Will and then allows player C to effectively counter the win.

### Intentionally Drawing Games

While it is completely acceptable that players decide to Intentionally Draw a game, and in some situations, it can be an elegant solution to an apparently “King-making” situation, there are some implications, when it comes to tournament logistics and player conduct:

- In Single Elimination Rounds, given the preference for unlimited time, it’s possible that multiple games end in an Intentional Draw. In order to prevent extending the tournament indefinitely, after the first Intentionally Drawn game, there will be a time limit put in place. This time limit will also include the time already spent on the game. Check the section above for details.
- In Swiss Rounds, players can opt to Intentionally Draw individual games or the whole match. If players opt to Intentionally Draw a game, they can (and are encouraged) start another game, as long as there is still time left in the round.
- In any situation, a player cannot be coerced into Intentionally Drawing a game. This means that you can propose an Intentional Draw, but you can’t forcefully impose it on an opponent.
- Sometimes players can make deals to “kill” a player that doesn’t agree to an Intentional Draw, so that the remaining players can then agree to Intentionally Draw the game. Keep in mind that judges will not enforce upholding such deals, same as with any other deals.

Here are some examples regarding coercion:

- Player A is presenting a win, player B has a win next turn and this is known information. It’s not acceptable that player C attempts to “blackmail” a player: “If you don’t want to draw, then I will cast Silence and you lose to player B” or “You have to accept the draw, or else we will kill you and we draw anyway”.
- Player A is presenting a win, player B has a win next turn and this is known information. It is acceptable that player C attempts to politely reason with the players: “Player A, I have this Silence. Do you want to draw? No? Ok, but please consider that if we make a deal to kill you it’s way riskier since B can break the deal and we end up losing the game instead of everyone drawing”.

Attempting to coerce a player into accepting an Intentional Draw constitutes a violation of the code of conduct and will be treated as such.

### Mana/Priority Bullying

While it is completely acceptable that players “sandbag” their answers and pass priority, it is not acceptable that players ask other players to perform an action so they can receive priority back.

If during one of your games a player passes priority and then asks you to perform an action so they can get priority back, call a Judge.

Asking a player to perform an action in order to receive priority back constitutes a violation of the code of conduct and will be treated as such.

### Slow Play/Stalling

Given the lengthy nature of the format, and the time limit, it is very important that we all fight to combat slow play and ultimately reduce the chance for stalling abuse. Because of this, we want to encourage all players to actively call a Judge if you feel that an opponent is taking more than a reasonable amount of time making a decision. The Judge team can only give you extra time if you call them during the round!

### Conceding

Some cards, strategies, or lines of play, such as those associated with Najeela or Tivit are reliant on the multiplayer aspect of commander. To facilitate these, players must concede on their turn with an empty stack. This gives all players the opportunity to play to their deck’s strategies. The following exceptions apply to this rule:

- If a player is uncomfortable in a match and would like to discontinue a match as a result, please immediately call a Judge.
- If a player must leave due to an emergency, please immediately call a Judge.

As per the [MAMTR - 2.5](https://topdeck.gg/mtr-ipg-addendum). During a multiplayer game players are encouraged to concede while they have priority and the stack is empty on their own turn. A player who needs to concede at any other time will be dropped from the event and must talk to the tournament organiser in order to re-enter. In this case a judge will facilitate any mandatory actions of the conceded player until the stack is empty. In the event this happens in response to combat the turn will be facilitated until the end of combat. - If a player conceding at “instant speed” would affect the outcome of the match, the player and all permanents controlled by them beforehand are considered to still exist until the end of the current phase.

### Table Talk

We understand that discussion between players, planning, and strategy is an integral part of commander play.

The penalty “Outside Assistance” will only apply in either of the following scenarios:

- When players in a match asks for or refers to information from a person or medium outside the current match other than a Judge.
- When a player not involved in the current match, spectator, or any other person offers or otherwise communicates information to a player engaged in a match.

- As per the Outside Assistance Section - players that are eliminated during a match are considered spectators and their involvement would be considered outside assistance.

- All players must remain in their seats during the game. If a pause is needed, call a Judge.

When discussing cards at the table:

- Players are not required to disclose hidden information, although they may do so if they desire, as long as they follow the rules defined in the MAMTR - 3.13 Hidden Information
- Judges will not enforce contracts or promises.
- When resolving cards like Intuition, Thoughtseize, or similar, a player may choose to solicit advice from their opponents. Be wary. Your opponents do not have your best interests at heart.
- Be sure to ask for advice before making your decision. Judges will not allow take backs after  strategic information has been gained.

## Recording and Image Capture

At cEDH UK events photography and video recording may take place for the purposes of promotion or gameplay capture. If you would like to be excluded from this please notify the TO prior to the event.
